# Stock Price Prediction Using Stacked LSTM

This project leverages a deep learning model, specifically a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to predict stock prices based on historical data. The approach aims to provide accurate predictions by capturing temporal dependencies in stock price trends.

## Overview

Financial markets are complex and influenced by numerous factors. Traditional models often fail to capture non-linear patterns and dependencies in stock price data. This project applies deep learning techniques, particularly Stacked LSTM, to address these challenges. The model processes time-series data, learns sequential patterns, and predicts future prices.


## Features

- **Time-Series Data Processing:** Handles stock price data with proper normalization and transformation.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Implements a multi-layered LSTM architecture for robust predictions.
- **Visualizations:** Provides plots for historical prices, predictions, and loss metrics.
- **Scalability:** Easily adaptable to other time-series prediction tasks.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vibhanshudixit/Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting.git
   cd Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting



## Usage
-Open the Jupyter Notebook

-Load your dataset or use the provided example dataset.

-Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the model and generate predictions.

-Evaluate and visualize the results.

## Dependencies
1. Python 3.7+
2. TensorFlow/Keras
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn

## Results
The model achieves reliable predictions for stock prices based on historical data. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and visual comparison plots highlight the model's performance.
